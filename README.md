# 143-Final-Project
This repository contains the cleaned data and analysis do-file for my final project in Economics 143 (Advanced Econometrics), for Spring 2021. The raw data was acquired from the [Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foodaps-national-household-food-acquisition-and-purchase-survey/) (FoodAPS), conducted by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The included do-file imports and extracts the relevant data and saves it as a Stata .dta file. Then, it proceeds to run the analysis described in my project. In this way the results are fully reproducible, and can be compared with the included results file (`output.log`).
